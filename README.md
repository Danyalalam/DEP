#  House Price Prediction
Welcome to the House Price Prediction project! This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict house prices based on various features.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that estimates house prices based on specific attributes such as location, size, number of rooms, etc. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps, all encapsulated in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for modeling.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and understanding the key features affecting house prices.
- Model Training: Applying various machine learning algorithms to build predictive models.
- Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- Prediction: Using the trained model to predict prices on new data.

## Model and Methodology
The project explores and implements various regression models to predict house prices. The key steps include:

- Data Loading and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and feature scaling.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Using plots to understand the relationships between features and the target variable.
- Model Building and Training: Training models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
- Model Evaluation: Comparing model performance using metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² score.
